    <p>When Amanda Gorman stepped up to the podium on the morning of January 20, 2021, her voice carried the weight of history and the buoyancy of youth. At 22, clad in bright yellow and red, she cut through the frosty air with words that felt both ancient and impossibly fresh. "We are not broken," she told the world. "We are unfinished."</p>

    <p>The poem--<em>The Hill We Climb</em>--was a moment of balm after rupture. The Capitol had been stormed just two weeks earlier; the pandemic still raged; the nation staggered from the dual trauma of political violence and a virus that had exposed every inequality it could. And yet, Gorman managed not only to speak of these wounds, but to suggest a future that might still be made whole. Her verses fluttered with cautious optimism, the scaffolding of a better republic.</p>

    <blockquote>"We are not broken. We are unfinished."</blockquote>

    <p>This was Gorman’s refrain, both declaration and plea. America, in her telling, was a work in progress--not failed, merely interrupted. It was a generous reading in 2021, and a radical one now. Four years on, the word "unfinished" has begun to feel euphemistic. Executive power has consolidated in alarming ways. ICE is no longer just monitoring borders--it’s monitoring students. Book bans have moved from fringe fantasy to state-level policy. Dissent, especially of the youthful, activist kind that once lifted Gorman herself, is now met with surveillance and arrest.</p>

    <blockquote>"We’ve braved the belly of the beast."</blockquote>

    <p>The line was an invocation of shared struggle, a suggestion that we had come through the worst. But in 2025, the "beast" has changed costume, not character. A second Trump presidency has brought with it an unapologetic programme of retribution. "Liberation Day," slated for April 2, will introduce sweeping tariffs framed as economic emancipation but carrying isolationist undertones. The machinery of state has been retrofitted to reward allegiance and punish critique.</p>

    <blockquote>"For there is always light, if only we’re brave enough to see it. If only we’re brave enough to be it."</blockquote>

    <p>It was the poem’s most quoted line, destined for tote bags and teacher posters, and rightly so. Yet in the current climate, being the light is not without consequence. Student protests are met not with debate but detention. There is a quiet danger in Gorman’s invitation--for those who take her seriously may now be labelled threats.</p>

    <p>Still, in corners of the country, people do take her seriously. The courage persists, scattered but luminous. The light hasn’t vanished. It’s just harder to spot from the national stage.</p>

    <blockquote>"Somehow we’ve weathered and witnessed a nation that isn’t broken but simply unfinished."</blockquote>

    <p>Reiterating the theme of resilience, this line underscored the belief in America’s capacity to evolve. And perhaps that’s where we must leave things--not in a sweeping judgment of success or failure, but in an honest confrontation of the moment.</p>

    <p>The hill remains. The climb continues. But the air is thinner now, the paths more treacherous. What once looked like sunrise feels more like dusk.</p>

    <p>And yet--there are those still writing, still marching, still hoping. Amanda Gorman among them. She has continued to publish, to speak, to gently prod the nation back toward the better angels of its own making.</p>

    <p>She would want us to end with hope. Not a blind hope, but the kind she practiced: spoken aloud, sharpened by history, and brave enough to stand alone on a platform and believe that words can still do something.</p>
